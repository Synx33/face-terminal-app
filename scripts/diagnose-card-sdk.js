// Connects to the DS-K2802 card-reader controller and prints every
// real-time access-control event it sees for 60 seconds, decoded. Use this
// after setting up CARD_DEVICE_IP (and vendor/hcnetsdk/win64/, see README)
// to confirm the connection actually works and to see what a REAL card
// swipe looks like decoded, before relying on it silently inside the app.
//
// Run from the install directory so .env is picked up:
//   node --env-file=.env scripts\diagnose-card-sdk.js
//
// What a healthy run looks like:
//   1. "connected, lUserID = N" -- login succeeded.
//   2. Swipe a real card at the reader within the 60s window.
//   3. An "EVENT" line prints with a non-null cardNo matching the card's
//      actual printed/encoded number, and a timestamp matching right now.
// If nothing prints for a genuine swipe, or cardNo is always null even for
// a real swipe, that's the thing to investigate next -- see cardSdk.js's
// extractCardNo() comment for how that field is currently located.
