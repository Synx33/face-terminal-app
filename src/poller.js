// back in March 2025 — an unrelated historical backlog, not real-time
// verification events. Zero real (major=5, named) events showed up in that
// flood even after a live face scan. Polling AcsEvent directly is the same
// call already proven correct in backfill.js: ask for a narrow time window,
// insert deduped by the device's own serialNo. Slower to notice a scan
// (poll interval, not instant push) but actually delivers the data.
